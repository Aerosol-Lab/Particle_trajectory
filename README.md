# Particle_trajectory
## 1. Introduction
This code is a particle trajectory simulator that is coupled with steady-state CFD simulation (one-way coupling). Since the genral drag coefficient model is implemented, this code should be capable on the supersonic flow problem.  The OpenFOAM mesh geometry file and field profiles are readily available as input file structures that require no modifications. Although Fluent CFD results are also available, they need to be transformed to OpenFOAM format which converter is in this repository.
